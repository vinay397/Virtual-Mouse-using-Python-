# Virtual-Mouse-using-Python
Welcome to the Virtual Mouse project, a Python-based solution that brings a new dimension to user-computer interaction. This project leverages computer vision and hand gesture recognition to create a virtual mouse, allowing users to control their cursor with simple hand movements.

Overview

Traditional input devices are given a modern twist as this project introduces an innovative approach to cursor control. By using a webcam to detect hand gestures, users can navigate their computers effortlessly, mimicking mouse actions with intuitive movements.

Features

Gesture-Controlled Cursor: Wave goodbye to your physical mouse! Effortlessly move the cursor using natural hand gestures. User-Friendly Calibration: The system provides an easy calibration process, ensuring accurate and personalized gesture recognition. Intuitive Actions: Execute left-click, right-click, and scroll actions seamlessly with predefined hand gestures. Getting Started

Prerequisites Make sure you have Python 3.x installed along with the required libraries: pip install opencv-python pyautogui Installation Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/vinay397/Virtual-Mouse-using-Python-.git
